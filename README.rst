Jubatus Python Client
=====================

(Forked) Jubatus client library for Python.
See `pypi <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jubatus>`_ for the latest release.

All codes are generated by ``jenerator`` .
But in this repository, all of generated codes are included in ``jubatus/`` dir.
Cause it's really messy to generate those files on own enviroments.
